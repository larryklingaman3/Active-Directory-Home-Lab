# Active-Directory-Home-Lab

## Objective

The objective of this project was to create an Active Directory (AD) home lab environment using Windows Server 2019. Utilizing PowerShell scripting, the focus was on automating the provisioning, maintenance, and deprovisioning of user accounts within the AD environment. By building this lab, I aimed to gain hands-on experience with AD administration and PowerShell automation.

### Skills Learned

- Setup and configuration of Active Directory on Windows Server 2019.
- Understanding of Active Directory user account management.
- Proficiency in PowerShell scripting for automation tasks.
- Automation of user provisioning, maintenance, and deprovisioning processes.
- Troubleshooting and debugging PowerShell scripts for AD administration.
- Knowledge of best practices for AD user account management and automation.

### Tools Used

- Windows Server 2019 for hosting the Active Directory environment.
- Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) for manual user management (initial setup).
- PowerShell scripting for automation of user provisioning, maintenance, and deprovisioning.

## Steps
1. Installation and configuration of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) on Windows Server 2019.
2. Initial setup of user accounts and groups using Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC).
3. Development of PowerShell scripts for automated user provisioning.
4. Testing and refining the PowerShell scripts for accuracy and efficiency.
5. Implementation of automated maintenance tasks such as password resets and group membership management.
6. Creation of PowerShell scripts for user deprovisioning, including account removal and cleanup tasks.
7. Testing the complete automation workflow to ensure functionality and reliability.
8. Documentation of the entire process, including script explanations and usage instructions.
